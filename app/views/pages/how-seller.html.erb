		<p id='customize-paragraph'>Simply pick your price, list any important info, upload some awesome pictures, and finally choose your shippping price. We think charging for things like item pictures is silly, so upload away!</p>

		<ul id='get-matched-paragraph'>
			<li>-We'll match you with buyers who are looking for items like yours. </li>
			<li>-If a buyer decides they want to purchase yours, we will notify you.</li>
			<li>-Your item listings don't expire so simply list and we'll do the hard part!</li>
		</ul>
	<div id='enjoy'>
		<h1 id='enjoy-header'>Congrats on the Sale!</h1>
		<ul id='enjoy-paragraph'>
			<li>-Because you pick your own price, you no longer have to worry about someone winning an auction at a lower price than what you had in mind.</li>
			<li>-Here at Denarri, we believe that the seller deserves to get the most for their item, which is why listing is free of charge. We only collect a small (7%) fee on the final sale price.</li>
